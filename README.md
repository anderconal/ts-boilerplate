# TypeScript Boilerplate

This is a lightweight TypeScript boilerplate that uses Jest for testing.

Delete or rename the existing `src/HelloWorld.ts` and `src/HelloWorld.test.ts` files to reflect your preferred names.

`npm run lint` will compare your code against the linter settings. This repository is set to use `tabs` for indentation, no semi-colons, and single quotes.

`npm run test` will run your tests.
